(a) Fit a regression tree with lpsa as the response and the other variables as predictors.
Use cross-validation to determine the optimal tree size. Which tree size corresponds
to the lowest cross-validation error? Is this the same as the tree size obtained using
the 1 SE rule?

```{r}
set.seed(1)
data("Prostate")
ctrl <- trainControl(method = "cv")
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
tree <- rpart(formula = lpsa~., data = Prostate,
               control = rpart.control(cp = 0.01))
cpTable <- printcp(tree)
plotcp(tree)
```
```{r}
minErr <- which.min(cpTable[,4])
minErr
```
The tree size 8 corresponds to the lowest cross-validation error.

```{r}
cpTable[cpTable[,4] < cpTable[minErr,4] + cpTable[minErr,5],1][1]  
```
The tree size obtained using the 1 SE rule is 3.

(b) Create a plot of the final tree you choose. Pick one of the terminal nodes, and
interpret the information displayed.

```{r}
tree_a = prune(tree, cp = cpTable[cpTable[,4] < cpTable[minErr,4] + cpTable[minErr,5], 1][1])
rpart.plot(tree_a)
```

(c) Perform bagging and report the variable importance

```{r}
bagging.grid <- expand.grid(mtry = 1:6,
                       splitrule = "variance",
                       min.node.size = 1:15)
set.seed(1)
bagging <- train(lpsa~., Prostate, 
                method = "ranger",
                tuneGrid = bagging.grid,
                trControl = ctrl,
                importance = "permutation")

ggplot(bagging, highlight = TRUE)
```

```{r}
barplot(sort(ranger::importance(bagging$finalModel), decreasing = FALSE), 
        las = 2, horiz = TRUE, cex.names = 0.7,
        col = colorRampPalette(colors = c("darkred","white","darkblue"))(19))
```
The important variables are : lcavol, lweight, svi

(d) Perform random forests and report the variable importance.

```{r}
rf.grid = expand.grid(mtry = 1:6, 
                       splitrule = "variance",
                       min.node.size = 1:15) 
set.seed(1)
rf.fit = train(lpsa~., Prostate, 
                method = "ranger",
                tuneGrid = rf.grid,
                trControl = ctrl,
                importance = 'permutation')
ggplot(rf.fit, highlight = TRUE)
```


```{r}
barplot(sort(ranger::importance(rf.fit$finalModel), decreasing = FALSE), 
        las = 2, horiz = TRUE, cex.names = 0.7,
        col = colorRampPalette(colors = c("darkred","white","darkblue"))(19))
```

(e) Perform boosting and report the variable importance.

```{r}
gbm.grid <- expand.grid(n.trees = c(2000,3000),
                        interaction.depth = 2:10,
                        shrinkage = c(0.001,0.003,0.005),
                        n.minobsinnode = 1)
set.seed(1)
gbm.fit <- train(lpsa~., Prostate, 
                 method = "gbm",
                 tuneGrid = gbm.grid,
                 trControl = ctrl,
                 verbose = FALSE)

ggplot(gbm.fit, highlight = TRUE)
```

Variable importance from boosting can be obtained using the `summary()` function.

```{r}
summary(gbm.fit$finalModel, las = 2, cBars = 19, cex.names = 0.6)
```

(f) Which of the above models will you select to predict PSA level? Explain.

```{r}
resamp <- resamples(list(bagging = bagging, rf = rf.fit, gbm = gbm.fit))
summary(resamp)
bwplot(resamp, metric = "RMSE")
```

2. This problem involves the OJ data in the ISLR package. The data contains 1070 purchases
where the customers either purchased Citrus Hill or Minute Maid Orange Juice. A number
of characteristics of customers and products are recorded. Create a training set containing
a random sample of 800 observations, and a test set containing the remaining observations.
Use set.seed() for reproducible results.

```{r}
data("OJ")
```


(a) Fit a classification tree to the training set, with Purchase as the response and the
other variables as predictors. Use cross-validation to determine the tree size and
create a plot of the final tree. Predict the response on the test data. What is the test
classification error rate?
